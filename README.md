# Author-Network-Analysis

### Description

##### This repository provides Python code for undertaking network analyis of authors from publications. The code produced a graph model in which nodes show authros and edges show connections between authors. The code calculates key centrality measures including degree, eigenvector and betweeness centrality. The resulting graph model is exported to Gephi where visualisations such as the one below can be produced. The code is useful for identifying key researchers  within a field and connections between communtiies. It coudl also be used to inform the decisions of research fundign organisations: for example, the identification of peer reviewers and members of review committees. The following article was useful in developing this approach: https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/exploring-and-analyzing-network-data-with-python
