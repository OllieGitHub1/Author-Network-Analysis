# Author-Network-Analysis

### Description

##### This repository provides Python code for undertaking network analyis of authors included in publications. The code calculates key centrality measures including degree, eigenvector and betweeness centrality. The resulting graph model is exported to Gephi where visualisations such as the one below can be produced. The code is useful for identifying key researchers (nodes) within a field and their connections to other communtiies. The following article was useful in developing this approach: https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/exploring-and-analyzing-network-data-with-python
